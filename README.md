# Java_Projects

This repository contains Java projects that I have completed during the summer (June - July) of 2017 and that come from the online programming courses (Object oriented programming with Java, part 1 and part 2) of mooc.fi. There are over one hundred assignments, which include all of part 1. 

My projects cover a range of topics, including the implementation of different types of data structures (ArrayList and HashMap) and sorting and searching algorithms.
